Python 2.7 is needed to run the sandbox. A makefile is not applicable because the sandbox is built and executed with the Python interpreter.

To run programs in the sandbox:
1. Use the command line
2. cd into the directory containing Sandbox.py and your custom program
2. Type python Sandbox.py [program_name]
3. Replace [program_name] with the name of your program
